# Landing Page Project

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Program, the course included the HTML and CSS files as the starter code. Built a multi-section landing page that we can add content to the page; improve the usability of a static site and dynamically updating the navigational menu. The interaction with the navigation menu should lead to scrolling the page to the appropriate section.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
